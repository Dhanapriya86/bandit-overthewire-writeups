# Bandit Level 23 → Level 24

## What I did
Created my own script so that the cron job would run it and reveal the password.

## Commands I used
cd /tmp
nano myscript.sh
chmod +x myscript.sh
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24

## Result
Found the password for Level 24 (not shared here).

## What I learned
- How cron executes scripts automatically
- How script permissions work in Linux
